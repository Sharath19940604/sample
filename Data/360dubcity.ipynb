The lyrics are inspired by Hilarys friendship with Kurdish refugees and by working with people who had arrive in Ireland seeking refuge. The song is used as a call to end the direct provision service in Ireland and implement a more humane system for people arriving here.

      "Freud&rsquo;s interest in Yeats is little discussed, but he had a lifelong interest in the Irish painter&rsquo;s work, holding a deep admiration for its force and energy. He did not cite Yeats as an &lsquo;influence&rsquo; but instead seems to have felt a common purpose with his originality and independence, his continuous searching observation, and his sense of the connection between painting and life. A pen and ink drawing by Yeats, The Dancing Stevedores (c.1900), hung beside Freud&rsquo;s bed for over 20 years.<br />\n",

      "Life Above Everything includes a substantial number of oil paintings by both artists, 33 by Freud and 24 by Yeats, as well as a range of works on paper, sourced from public and private collections internationally. There are five new loans of work by Freud to the IMMA Collection: Freud Project including important early works such as Girl with Roses (1947-48), Girl with Beret (1951) and Boat, Connemara (1951). Significant loans of works by Yeats include The Bus by the River (1927), People in a Street (c.1935), A Dancer (Rosses Point, Sligo) (1921), as well as From the Tram Top (c. 1925), which features one of Yeats&rsquo;s rare cameos in his own work.<br />\n",

      "Unique to this exhibition is the inclusion of seven paintings by Jack B. Yeats which Freud selected for a close friend, advising him on works to acquire at auction or through the relevant gallery.

      "The Irish Potato Famine was the most catastrophic event in Ireland&#039;s turbulent history. It is also regarded as being one of the worst Famines in history (deaths as a proportion to population). The use of the word &lsquo;Famine&#039; in this context is controversial, for Ireland at the time was part of the richest Empire in the World (the British Empire). There was sufficient food in the country throughout the &lsquo;Famine&#039; years, yet over a million people died from starvation and disease, and millions more were forced to flee. Some historians prefer to use the name &lsquo;Great Hunger&#039; to describe this period of mass death from starvation and disease.<br />\n",
      "<br />\n",
      "This exhibition tells the story of what happened during those horrific years. Rare 19th century photographs, witness accounts, contemporary sketches as well as maps and statistical information are used. A 15 minute film with seating is included in the exhibition and the average time spent by visitors is 1 hour. This exhibition is dedicated to all victims of the Irish Potato Famine or The Great Hunger.<br />\n",

      "The Irish Potato Famine was the most catastrophic event in Ireland's turbulent history. It is also regarded as being one of the worst Famines in history (deaths as a proportion to population). The use of the word ‘Famine' in this context is controversial, for Ireland at the time was part of the richest Empire in the World (the British Empire). There was sufficient food in the country throughout the ‘Famine' years, yet over a million people died from starvation and disease, and millions more were forced to flee. Some historians prefer to use the name ‘Great Hunger' to describe this period of mass death from starvation and disease.<br/>\n",

Exploring the affinities and interconnections between these two artists, this exhibition draws the work of these two stubbornly individual painters into dialogue, placing them side-by-side for the first time in 70 years.<br />\n",
      "<br />\n",
      "While Lucian Freud&rsquo;s work has been exhibited in the past in group exhibitions alongside other artists from the &lsquo;School of London&rsquo;, Life above Everything is one of the few exhibitions to date in which Freud has been shown with a single other artist.<br />\n",
      "<br />\n",
      "Freud&rsquo;s interest in Yeats is little discussed, but he had a lifelong interest in the Irish painter&rsquo;s work, holding a deep admiration for its force and energy. He did not cite Yeats as an &lsquo;influence&rsquo; but instead seems to have felt a common purpose with his originality and independence, his continuous searching observation, and his sense of the connection between painting and life. A pen and ink drawing by Yeats, The Dancing Stevedores (c.1900), hung beside Freud&rsquo;s bed for over 20 years.<br />\n",
      "<br />\n",
      "Life Above Everything includes a substantial number of oil paintings by both artists, 33 by Freud and 24 by Yeats, as well as a range of works on paper, sourced from public and private collections internationally. There are five new loans of work by Freud to the IMMA Collection: Freud Project including important early works such as Girl with Roses (1947-48), Girl with Beret (1951) and Boat, Connemara (1951). Significant loans of works by Yeats include The Bus by the River (1927), People in a Street (c.1935), A Dancer (Rosses Point, Sligo) (1921), as well as From the Tram Top (c. 1925), which features one of Yeats&rsquo;s rare cameos in his own work.<br />\n",
      "<br />\n",
      "Unique to this exhibition is the inclusion of seven paintings by Jack B. Yeats which Freud selected for a close friend, advising him on works to acquire at auction or through the relevant gallery. We are delighted to be able to present these seven paintings, &lsquo;approved&rsquo; by Freud, as a special grouping of Yeats&rsquo;s works within this exhibition.<br />\n",
      "<br />\n",
      "David Dawson, artist and Freud&rsquo;s long-time studio assistant, has assisted in the selection for this exhibition, bringing to the project a unique, intimate knowledge of Freud&rsquo;s interest in Yeats.<br />\n",
      "<br />\n",
      "The exhibition is made possible by the IMMA Collection: Freud Project 2016-2021, a five-year loan of 52 works by Lucian Freud to the IMMA Collection by private lenders. This is the fourth exhibition to be presented as part of the project.<br />\n",

Sean is a rescue diver and trained maritime search and rescuer. He volunteered as a coordinator of civilian rescue operations, both on land and at sea, in Greece, in 2018. Despite continued cooperation with the authorities, Sean was arrested for his humanitarian work and spent 106 days in pre-trial detention. The case remains ongoing and he faces 25 years imprisonment.<br />\n",
       "<br />\n",
       "A musical highlight of the evening is a performance of Dont See Any Lines by singer/songwriter Hilary Bow featuring Hilary Bow and Liam O Maonlai on vocals. The single Dont See Any Lines was released on World Refugee Day (20 June 2019) by Cork Singer/Songwriter Hilary Bow. The lyrics are inspired by Hilarys friendship with Kurdish refugees and by working with people who had arrive in Ireland seeking refuge. The song is used as a call to end the direct provision service in Ireland and implement a more humane system for people arriving here.

The use of the word ‘Famine' in this context is controversial, for Ireland at the time was part of the richest Empire in the World (the British Empire). There was sufficient food in the country throughout the ‘Famine' years, yet over a million people died from starvation and disease, and millions more were forced to flee.

Rare 19th century photographs, witness accounts, contemporary sketches as well as maps and statistical information are used.

He did not cite Yeats as an ‘influence’ but instead seems to have felt a common purpose with his originality and independence, his continuous searching observation, and his sense of the connection between painting and life. A pen and ink drawing by Yeats, The Dancing Stevedores (c.1900), hung beside Freud’s bed for over 20 years.\\n\\nLife Above Everything includes a substantial number of oil paintings by both artists, 33 by Freud and 24 by Yeats, as well as a range of works on paper, sourced from public and private collections internationally. There are five new loans of work by Freud to the IMMA Collection: Freud Project including important early works such as Girl with Roses (1947-48), Girl with Beret (1951) and Boat, Connemara (1951). Significant loans of works by Yeats include The Bus by the River (1927), People in a Street (c.1935), A Dancer (Rosses Point, Sligo) (1921), as well as From the Tram Top (c. 1925), which features one of Yeats’s rare cameos in his own work.\\n\\nUnique to this exhibition is the inclusion of seven paintings by Jack B. Yeats which Freud selected for a close friend, advising him on works to acquire at auction or through the relevant gallery. We are delighted to be able to present these seven paintings, ‘approved’ by Freud, as a special grouping of Yeats’s works within this exhibition.\\n\\nDavid Dawson, artist and Freud’s long-time studio assistant, has assisted in the selection for this exhibition, bringing to the project a unique, intimate knowledge of Freud’s interest in Yeats.\\n\\nThe exhibition is made possible by the IMMA Collection: Freud Project 2016-2021, a five-year loan of 52 works by Lucian Freud to the IMMA Collection by private lenders.

He did not cite Yeats as an ‘influence’ but instead seems to have felt a common purpose with his originality and independence, his continuous searching observation, and his sense of the connection between painting and life. A pen and ink drawing by Yeats, The Dancing Stevedores (c.1900), hung beside Freud’s bed for over 20 years.\\n\\nLife Above Everything includes a substantial number of oil paintings by both artists, 33 by Freud and 24 by Yeats, as well as a range of works on paper, sourced from public and private collections internationally.

Significant loans of works by Yeats include The Bus by the River (1927), People in a Street (c.1935), A Dancer (Rosses Point, Sligo) (1921), as well as From the Tram Top (c. 1925), which features one of Yeats’s rare cameos in his own work.\\n\\nUnique to this exhibition is the inclusion of seven paintings by Jack B. Yeats which Freud selected for a close friend, advising him on works to acquire at auction or through the relevant gallery. We are delighted to be able to present these seven paintings, ‘approved’ by Freud, as a special grouping of Yeats’s works within this exhibition.\\n\\nDavid Dawson, artist and Freud’s long-time studio assistant, has assisted in the selection for this exhibition, bringing to the project a unique, intimate knowledge of Freud’s interest in Yeats.\\n\\nThe exhibition is made possible by the IMMA Collection: Freud Project 2016-2021, a five-year loan of 52 works by Lucian Freud to the IMMA Collection by private lenders.
